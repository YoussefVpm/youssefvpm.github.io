Description:
===

PairT stands for Pressure + Air + Temperature. It consist of designing a small weather station, which feature a high-precision digital relative humidity/temperature sensor and a high-precision digital pressure sensor. It incoporates an LCD display to show real time values. The project is also part of practice of my PCB design skills along with embedded systems.

### Summary 

Goal:
===
Design of a PCB sheild for Pressure and Temperature monitoring with arduino headers for flexible and rapid development. It allows rapid prototyping to evaluate microcontrollers with a wide range of capabilities across a broad price range.

Motivation:
===

Vertical farming is an innovative and sustainable agricultural practice that involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers. This method is designed to maximize space efficiency, increase crop yields, and minimize environmental impact. So, in order to increase crop yield, Reduced Environmental Impact and maximize Resource Efficiency a great factor is to monitor the temperature and pressure of the enclosed space.

Specificaton:
===
- Relative Humidity/Temperature Sensor, HTU21D
- Pressure Sensor, MS5611
- Newhaven Display LCD display

ECAD and CAD outcome
===

In the course of this the PairT project, I also designed a small enclosure (using Fusion 360) for the PCB stacked along on the popular <a href="[url](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3)">Arduino uno board</a>. 3D printing is thus a great tool for prototyping enclosures and for getting first impression of the look. The enclosure will be mounted using M3 screws with nuts.

Future Work
===

- Printing the circuit board from a popular service provider like <a href="[url](https://jlcpcb.com/)">JLCPCB</a>
- Running and testing the Firmware
- Incorporating Wireless communication
