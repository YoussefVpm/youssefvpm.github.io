### _Skills: MATLAB, Image Segmentation, Image Processing Toolbox_

****

Summary:
===
The Goal of is to measure images or frame within an image, which can be important in many computer vision applications. This could help avoid phyical measurements which could eventually be tideous.

Software:
===
* MATLAB 2020a
* Image Processing Toolbox

Process:
===


Results and discussion:
===
The diameter is displayes on the window where the units is in pixel. This approach is manual which means this script is has a less degree of freedon for only this image and could not be applied with other images with for example high saturation, hue or vibrance.
