Demo:
===

This project simulates a 2D Kinematics of a Unicycle Mobile robot using simulink. It uses different controller gains based on different scenarios to make the mobile robot achieve specific task.

Overview
===

- The robot changes maneuver in a simple lane
- The robot moves from an arbitary point to a defined position in space
- The robot follows a spcified line by steering.
